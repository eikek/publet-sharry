The files are uploaded to the server where they are zipped into a single archive and
immediately encrypted using either the given password or a generated one. The link
to this encrypted zip archive is open to everyone, but only the correct password
can decrypt the file. The link together with the password can then be shared with
others.

Additionally, each upload expires at some point in time. The files are then removed
from the server.
